# Schedule Manager Portal

The Form Portal provides an interface for staff members to input their availabilities and preferences.

These preferences will be taken into account when creating the schedule, and the algorithm will try to accomodate as many people's preferences as possible.

It is coded using `react` (via next.js). There is no back-end component to this service.

## Starting the project

Install node.js 18.17 or newer, and then open a terminal to the root of the next.js project, which is the `form-portal` folder. There, you can run

```bash
npm i
```

to install the dependencies. Once that's done, run

```bash
npm run dev
```

to start the front-end development server.
